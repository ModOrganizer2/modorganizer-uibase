/**
 * This header contains definition for the interface IFileTree and the FileTreeEntry
 * class.
 *
 * The purpose of IFileTree is to expose a file tree in a user-friendly way. The
 * IFileTree interface represent a "virtual" file tree: the tree may not exists on
 * the disk or anywhere, it is just an abstract structure. The source of the tree
 * is irrelevant to the IFileTree user and is an implementation details.
 *
 * IFileTree and FileTreeEntry are very intrically linked so it is not possible to
 * use FileTreeEntry for something else, and the only way to create FileTreeEntry
 * is through an existing IFileTree.
 *
 * IFileTree expose a mutable and a strict non-mutable interfaces based on
 * const-qualification of methods, but all underlying implementation are obviously
 * non-const.
 *
 * The IFileTree interface is implemented such that creating implementations should
 * be fairly easy (two short methods to implement). Implementation can override other
 * methods in order to reflect changes from the tree to the actual source (e.g.,
 * override the beforeX() methods to actually rename or move file on the disk).

 *
 * This interface already implements most of the usual methods for a file tree. Child
 * classes only have to implement methods to populate the tree and to create child tree
 * object.
 *
 * Read-only operations on the tree are thread-safe, even when the tree has not been
 * populated yet.
 *
 * In order to prevent wrong usage of the tree, implementing classes may throw
 * UnsupportedOperationException if an operation is not supported. By default, all
 * operations are supported, but some may not make sense in many situations.
 *
 * The goal of this is not reflect the change made to a IFileTree to the disk, but child
 * classes may override relevant methods to do so.
 *
 * The tree is built upon FileTreeEntry. A given tree holds shared pointers to its
 * entries while each entry holds a weak pointer to its parent, this means that the
 * descending link are strong (shared pointers) but the uplink are weaks.
 *
 * Accessing the parent is always done by locking the weak pointer so that returned
 * pointer or either null or valid. This structure implies that as long as the initial
 * root lives, entry should not be destroyed, unless the entry are detached from the
 * root and no shared pointers are kept.
 *
 * However, it is not guarantee that one can go up the tree from a single node entry. If
 * the root node is destroyed, it will not be possible to go up the tree, even if we
 * still have a valid shared pointer.
 *
 * The inheritance is made virtual to provide a way for child classes to use both a
 * custom FileTreeEntry and IFileTree implementations. This has no impact on the usage
 * of the interface.

   *   - makeDirectory(): used to create directories - this method serves to create
   * directory that may or may not existing in the underlying source. Implementing class
   * do not have to rely on this for `doPopulate()`. This method is also called when new
   *         directory needs to be created (addDirectory, insert, createOrphanTree,
   * merge, etc.), and may return a null pointer to indicate that the operations failed
   * or is not permitted.
   *   - doClone(): called when a tree needs to be cloned (e.g., for a copy) - this
   * methods does not copy the subtrees, it should only create an empty tree equivalent
   * to the current tree.
   *   - doPopulate(): called when a tree have to be populated.
   *
   * The other commons methods that can be re-implemented are:
   *   - makeFile(), this is used to create new file - this is very similar to
   * makeDirectory() except that it has a default implementation that simply creates a
   * FileTreeEntry.
   *   - beforeInsert(), beforeReplace() and beforeRemove(): these can be implemented to
   * 1) prevent some operations, 2) perform operations on the actual tree (e.g., move a
   * file on the disk).
